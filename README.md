# Murshidul Hasan Portfolio

This project now uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to serve a modern React based portfolio. The old static
`index.html` has been converted into a React component under `pages/index.js`. All images now live in
the `public/images` directory.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install    # install dependencies (requires internet access)
npm run dev    # start development server
npm test       # currently prints a placeholder message
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the site.


Legacy static files (`index.html`, `styles.css`) remain for reference.
